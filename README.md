# Top Infinity

A high school project that developped the idea from Top5 into a full stack app that lets users create accounts, add topics and items, and rate them. Uses Python Flask and a native SQL database connection. 

## Lessons Learned

This was my first full stack app and taught me a lot, including how to manage users (including malicious ones). The main challenges were using Flask to make such a complicated user system, including password management (using hashing and salting) and storing everything in a database. I also went through the process of taking my working app and self hosting it on a server I had running at home using Docker, which was a lot of fun!

The main takeaways from this project were that I needed to manage my code better (not having it all in one file), and use more advanced systems that would be more secure and harder to find workarounds to.
